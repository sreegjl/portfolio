# Hesiod's Works and Days

<font size=2>Disclaimer: These notes reflect the content and attitudes of the ancient sources I’m summarizing. They should not be interpreted as my personal opinions.</font>

Hesiod opens Works and Days by invoking the Pierian Muses and addressing Zeus, asking him to establish justice among mortals. He hopes that his poem will speak truth to Perses, his brother.  

Hesiod then explains that there are two kinds of Strife. One is blameworthy: the harsh, destructive Eris born first from Night, who fosters war, conflict, and ruin. The other Strife is praised: she stirs mortals to honest labor and productive competition. Hesiod urges Perses to reject Wicked Strife, which leads to quarrels and lawsuits, and instead to follow Good Strife, which drives a man to work diligently and prosper.

**Prometheus & Pandora**

Hesiod continues by explaining why human life is filled with labor. If the gods had not hidden the “means of life” from mortals, a single day’s work would suffice for a year’s sustenance. But after Prometheus deceives Zeus and steals fire for humanity, Zeus becomes enraged. In retaliation, he devises an evil for mankind: a woman fashioned as a trap. He commands Hephaistos to mix earth and water, and with the gifts and adornments of the other gods, Pandora is made.  Before Pandora, men lived free from sorrow, sickness, and painful toil. After she is sent to humanity, she brings grief and hardship with her very presence. Later, Hesiod describes a great jar containing countless Evils; when it is opened, these Evils scatter among humankind, leaving only Hope sealed inside.

**Five Ages of Man**

Hesiod then turns to a second tale, explaining how gods and mortals became separate and how the races of men declined over time.  

First, during the reign of Kronos, the Olympian gods fashioned the Golden Race of mortals. These humans lived like gods, free from sorrow, toil, and suffering; the earth gave its fruits freely, and Death came to them like gentle sleep. After their time ended, they were hidden beneath the earth, and they now exist as benevolent guardian spirits who watch over mortals and protect justice.  

Next, the gods created the Silver Race, inferior to the first. These men remained children for a hundred years, but once grown, lived only a short and painful life. They were arrogant, refused to honor the gods, and so Zeus destroyed them. They, too, were hidden beneath the earth, where they became spirits of the underworld.  

After this, Zeus created the Bronze Race, a people sprung from ash trees, mighty in strength, but obsessed with war and violence. Their hearts were hard, and their armor, tools, and houses were all of bronze. This race destroyed itself through its own brutality and, after death, descended to the house of Hades.  

When the Bronze Race still roamed the earth, Zeus fashioned a fourth race, the Race of Heroes, unlike the others and more just and noble. These were the demi-gods who fought at Thebes and Troy. Many perished in war, but others were given blessed lives on the Isles of the Blessed at the edge of the earth, where Kronos now rules over them.  

Finally, Zeus created the Iron Race, the race of Hesiod’s own time. These mortals live with unending toil, grief, and sorrow. Children dishonor parents, justice is corrupted, and violence fills the world. Hesiod laments that he must live among this race, for they will ultimately destroy themselves, and Zeus will wipe them out when their wickedness becomes too great.

**Hawk and Nightingale**

Hesiod continues onto a second tale, one of a hawk clutching a a nightingale in his claws. The nightingale cries out in sorrow, pleading to be pitied. But the hawk declares that resisting will only bring further suffering, as the stronger always rules the weaker, and that he can do do whatever he wishes with his prey.

Hesiod uses this tale to explain that while animals and birds have no law, Zeus punishes injustice in humans, especially when the powerful oppress the weak. Hesiod urges his brother to embrace Justice (Dike), born of Zeus, and refrain from greed and corruption. Badness is in abundance and is easily achievable, and Good is harder to achieve, but Justice always eventually triumphs.

**Hesiod's Advice**

Humble men often remain poor, while the wealthy carry themselves with confidence. But wealth gained through lies, injustice, or brute force does not endure; when such prosperity collapses, the gods reject the man who acquired it. Zeus in particular punishes those who violate sacred obligations: those who harm suppliants or guests, seduce a brother’s wife, wrong orphaned children, provoke violent quarrels, or abuse an aging father. Such men inevitably pay harsh penalties for their transgressions.

To have a good neighbor is a blessing, and to have a worthless one is a curse. Hesiod tells his brother that with watchful neighbors, cattle will never go missing, and to pay back the same, or more, when borrowing from neighbors. Give to generous men, but not stingy ones; Give is a "lovely girl," but Grab is destructive. Add to your stores to keep Famine away; even if you add a little bit and do it often, it will soon become big. Marry someone who brings no shame, from a family known for good character. A good wife helps a man prosper; a bad one consumes his labor like fire.

**Farmer's Calendar**

Hesiod then turns to the practical concerns of the farming year. He urges Perses to attend carefully to the seasons and the signs that mark the proper time for work. He gives instructions on plowing, sowing, reaping, and threshing, emphasizing that the man who works steadily at the right seasons will enjoy abundance. Winter is harsh and dangerous, so one must gather provisions early, store clothing and firewood, and protect livestock from the cold north winds. Spring and summer bring renewed labor in the fields and opportunities for gathering, pruning, and tending vines.

Hesiod then advises on the proper time for sailing. The sea is treacherous, and the man who trusts it carelessly courts ruin. He urges his brother to keep a well-built ship, avoid taking more cargo than it can bear, and pray to Zeus and Poseidon before setting sail.

Hesiod gives practical advice for daily life. Keep supplies on hand; let a hired servant know his duties; avoid excessive talk and drinking; and guard your reputation among neighbors. Choose companions wisely, for a man becomes like those with whom he lives. The man who is orderly at home, punctual in his work, and restrained in his behavior prospers under Zeus’s justice.

Hesiod ends the poem with a list of days that are auspicious or harmful for different kinds of tasks. Some days favor the birth of children, others the taming of oxen, the shearing of sheep, the cutting of wood, or the training of boys. Certain days are dangerous for marriage or travel, while others bring luck to those who work.
