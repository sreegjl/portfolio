# Late Bronze Age Collapse

The Late Bronze Age Collapse (c. 1200–1150 BCE) was a massive breakdown of interconnected civilizations across the eastern Mediterranean and Near East. In a few generations, nearly every major Bronze Age power disintegrated: the Mycenaean palaces of Ancient Greece burned, the Hittite Empire vanished, Ugarit and other Levantine cities were destroyed, and even Egypt barely survived repeated attacks from the so-called Sea Peoples. 

Archaeological and textual evidence suggest a “systems collapse” caused by multiple overlapping crises: foreign invasions, internal rebellions, drought and famine, earthquakes, and the disruption of long-distance trade in copper and tin. As the bronze economy failed, new iron technologies began to spread, marking the dawn of the Iron Age.  

The collapse ended centuries of palace-based bureaucracy and international exchange, plunging regions like Greece into a Dark Age where literacy and monumental building disappeared. Yet out of this turmoil emerged the foundations of later classical civilizations: early Greek communities, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and new centers of power around the Mediterranean. Centuries later, Greeks mythologized this fallen world in epics such as The Iliad and The Odyssey, preserving its memory as the heroic age that preceded their own.
