# Hesiod's Theogony

<font size=2>Disclaimer: These notes reflect the content and attitudes of the ancient sources I’m summarizing. They should not be interpreted as my personal opinions.</font>

At the start of the poem, the Heliconian Muses (Cleio, Euterpe, Melpomene, Thalia, Erato, Terpsichore, Polymia, Urania, and Calliope), the nine daughters of Zeus, are described as going to hymn Zeus, as well as the other immortal gods. In ancient Greek culture, the Muses are divine patrons of the arts, and one of their roles is to celebrate the king of the gods through song and poetry. 

It's stated that Calliope, the most important of the Muses, gives the ability to speak to those who are destined to become lords/kings. Hesiod claims that the Muses appeared to him while he was shepherding his lambs, gave him a staff, and "breathed a sacred voice" into his mouth, ordering him to sing the "race of blessed ones who live forever." The Muses help Hesiod tell the story of the *Theogony*.

Chaos is the first deity to appear, then Earth (Gaia), then Tartarus, and Eros (Love). From Chaos comes Night (Nyx) and Erebos, and from Night comes Day (Hemera) and Space. Earth bears Heaven (Ouranos), the Mountains, and Pontus, and with Heaven, has many children: Oceanus, Koios, Kreius, Iapetos, Hyperion, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Tethys, Phoebe, and Kronos. Earth then bears the Cyclopes: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges. Then, Heaven and Earth bear Kottos, Gyes, and Briareus, who are described as insolent children with a hundred arms and fifty heads.

Fearful that his children may rise up and usurp his power, Heaven imprisons Earth's children in a cave. Earth devises a plan to repay Heaven's "wicked crime," and forms a sickle, urging her sons to take action. Fear seizes them all, but Kronos steps forward. When Heaven comes to Earth, longing for love, Kronos, who was hidden, takes the sickle and harvests his father's genitals. The drops of Heaven's blood are received by Earth, who creates the Furies, Giants, and the nymphs called Meliae. The genitals are thrown into the sea, creating a white foam which comes to Cyprus, from which Aphrodite is born. Heaven angrily calls his sons Titans, and says that they will be punished.

Hesiod continues the genealogy of the gods. Night bears Doom, Ker, Death, Sleep, the tribe of Dreams, Blame, Distress, the Destinies and Fates, Nemesis, Deceit, Love (Philótēs), Age, and Strife. Strife then gives birth to Work, Forgetfulness, Famine, Pains, Battles and Fights, Murders, Killings of men, Quarrels and Lies, Stories and Disputes, Lawlessness and Ruin, and Oath. Pontus' firstborn child is Nereus. Pontus and Earth then produce Thaumas, Phorkys, Ceto, and Eurybie.

Hesiod continues into the genealogy of the sea. Nereus and Doris, daughter of Oceanus, bear the Nereids: Protho, Eukrante, Sao, Amphitrite, Eudore, Thetis, Galene, Glauce, Cymothoe, Speio, Thalia, Pasithea, Erato, Eunike, Melite, Eulimene, Agave, Doto, Proto, Pherousa, Dynamene, Nesaia, Aktaia, Protomedeia, Doris, Panope, Galatea, Hippothoe, Hipponoe, Cymodoce, Cymatolege, Cyme, Eione, Halimede, Glauconome, Pontoporeia, Leagore, Euagore, Laomedeia, Poulynome, Autonoe, Lysianassa, Euaerne, Psamathe, Menippe, Neso, Eupompe, Themisto, Pronoe, and Nemertes. Thaumas and Electra, daughter of Oceanus, bear Iris and the Harpies: Aello and Okypete.

Hesiod continues into the genealogy of monsters and boundary-creatures. Phorkys and Ceto bear the Graiae, grey-haired from birth: Pemphredo and Enyo. Phorkys and Ceto also bear the Gorgons, who dwell beyond Ocean near Night: Sthenno, Euryale, and Medusa. Sthenno and Euryale are immortal; Medusa is mortal. Medusa lies with Poseidon, and when Perseus cuts off her head, Chrysaor springs forth, and Pegasus the horse. Chrysaor bears his name from the golden blade he holds at birth. Pegasus flies up to the immortal gods and dwells in the house of Zeus, bringing thunder and lightning. Chrysaor and Callirrhoe, daughter of Oceanus, bear Geryon of the three heads. Heracles kills Geryon in sea-girt Erytheia and drives away his cattle, killing the herdsman Eurytion and the dog Orthos. Ceto bears another monster, Echidna, half fair-cheeked maiden and half great speckled snake, dwelling in a hollow cave beneath the earth, immortal and ageless. Typhoeus loves Echidna, and she bears fierce offspring: first Orthos, the dog of Geryon; next Cerberus, the brazen-voiced hound of Hades with fifty heads; then the Lernaean Hydra, whom Heracles kills with the help of Iolaus and Athena; then Chimaera, breathing dreadful fire, three-headed, lion, goat, and snake. Bellerophon and Pegasus kill Chimaera. Echidna later bears the deadly Sphinx, a curse upon the men of Thebes, and the Nemean Lion, brought up by Hera and slain by Heracles. Phorkys and Ceto bear their youngest child, a dreadful serpent who guards the golden apples at the far boundary of the dark earth.

Hesiod then turns away from monsters and boundary-creatures and resumes the genealogy of the gods of the sea and sky. Oceanus and Tethys bear the Rivers: Nile, Alpheios, Eridanos, Strymon, Meander, Ister, Phasis, Rhesus, Achelous, Nessus, Rhodius, Haliacmon, Heptaporus, Granicus, Aesepus, Simois, Peneus, Hermus, Caicus, Sangarius, Parthenius, Ladon, Evenus, Alpheus, and Scamander. Oceanus and Tethys also bear daughters, the Oceanids: Peitho, Admete, Ianthe, Electra, Doris, Prymno, Ourania, Hippo, Clymene, Rhodeia, Callirrhoe, Zeuxo, Klytie, Idyia, Pasithoe, Plexaure, Galaxaure, Dione, Melobosis, Thoe, Polydore, Kerkeis, Pluto, Perseis, Ianeira, Akaste, Xanthe, Petraie, Menestho, Europa, Metis, Eurynome, Telesto, Chryseis, Asia, Calypso, Eudore, Tyche, Amphiro, Okyrhoe, and Styx. Hyperion and Theia bear Helios, Selene, and Eos. Crius and Eurybia bear Astraios, Pallas, and Perses. Astraios and Eos bear the Winds: Zephyros, Notos, and Boreas, and also Eosphoros and the other stars. Pallas and Styx, daughter of Oceanus, bear Victory, Glory, Power, and Force.

Zeus promises that those who fight with him against the Titans will keep their honors, and that those who had no rank under Kronos will now receive rank and honor as is just. Styx, deathless, comes first to Olympus with her children, as her father advised. Zeus grants Styx honor and unequaled gifts, making her the great oath of the gods, and decrees that her children dwell always beside him. Phoibe comes to the bed of Koios, and she bears Leto, dark-robed, gentle, and kind to both mortals and immortals. Phoibe then bears Asteria, whom Perses leads to his house as bride. Last, Phoibe bears Hekate, whom above all Zeus honors. Zeus grants Hekate a share of earth, sea, and starry heaven. The immortal gods honor her greatly, and she is invoked by men in sacrifice. Whom Hekate favors, she grants wealth and power.  Of all the children Earth and Ocean bore, Hekate alone keeps her due honor, and the son of Kronos does not take away her rights.

Rhea, being forced by Kronos, bears Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. Fearing the same fate as his father, Kronos swallows each of these children. To spare Zeus, Rhea begs Earth and Heaven and devises a plan to hide Zeus in a cave under Mount Aegeum, giving Kronos a swaddled rock to swallow in place of the baby.

As Zeus grows to strength, Earth berates Kronos and advises him to bring his offspring back. Kronos first vomits the stone, which Zeus sets beneath Parnassus at Pytho; implicitly, the swallowed children follow.

Zeus frees his uncles, the Cyclopes and the Hundred-Handed Ones, whom Kronos had bound. In gratitude, the Cyclopes give Zeus thunder, lightning, and the blazing bolt, which Earth had previously hidden.

In the Titanomachy, Zeus and the Olympians defeat the Titans after a long hard battle. The Titans are sent under the Earth and put in chains at Tartarus, which is as far beneath the earth, as earth is far beneath the heavens. Tartarus is enclosed by a wall of bronze, and Night is spread around it threefold. The Hundred-Handed Ones stand guard over the Titans by the will of Zeus. Hesiod then turns to the dwelling place of Night. There live her children, including Sleep and Death, who move gently over the earth and sea.

After Zeus has driven the Titans into Tartarus, Earth, angered at their fate, bears a final child to challenge Zeus: Typhoeus. Typhoeus is a monstrous god, with a hundred serpent heads growing from his shoulders. Zeus casts Typhoeus into Tartarus, and from Typhoeus come fierce, destructive winds that bring ruin to mortals. With Typhoeus defeated, Zeus completes the ordering of the cosmos. The gods finish their work, and Zeus secures his rule over gods and mortals alike.

Klymene marries Iapetos and gives birth to Atlas, Menoitios, Prometheus, and Epimetheus. At Mekone, Prometheus attempts to deceive Zeus when gods and men divide an ox. Angered, Zeus withholds fire from mortal men, which Prometheus steals back for mankind. Zeus devises a punishment for men in return for fire and commands Hephaistos to fashion a maiden from earth. Zeus names her Pandora. Pandora is brought to men as a gift, and from her comes the race of women, a great evil for mortal men, who live among men and consume their labor.

After the Titanomachy, Menoitios is cast into Erebos by Zeus, and Atlas is forced by necessity to hold up the ends of Earth. Prometheus is bound by Zeus in unbreakable chains around a pillar, where an eagle comes to eat his deathless liver until he is later freed by Heracles, who kills the eagle.

Zeus takes his first wife, Metis, but when she is about to bear Athene, he deceives her mind and thrusts her into his belly so no other god would get the royal power over all the gods. Her fate would be to bear Tritogenia (Athene). Zeus' second wife, Themis, bears Horae, Order, Peace, Justice, and the Fates: Clotho, Atropos, and Lachesis. Eurynome, the daughter of Ocean, bears to Zeus the Graces: Aglaia, Euphrosyne, and Thalia. Demeter, bears to Zeus Persephone, and Mnemosyne bears the Muses. Leto joins in love with Zeus and bears Apollo and Artemis. Lastly, Zeus takes Hera for his wife, who bears Hebe, Ares, and Eileithuia. From Zeus' head  Athene is later born. Then, Hera angrily bears Hephaistos, without the act of love. 

After the Olympian order is established, Hesiod turns to the descendants of the gods and their unions with one another and with mortals. Poseidon joins with Amphitrite and fathers Triton, the wide-ruling god of the deep. Ares, through Cytheraea (Aphrodite), fathers Fear and Terror, who accompany him in war and sow confusion among mortals. 

Zeus continues to father both divine and semi-divine offspring. Maia, daughter of Atlas, bears Hermes, the herald of the gods. Semele bears Dionysos, who later joins the ranks of the immortals. Alcmene bears Heracles, who completes great labors and is later welcomed among the gods. Hephaistos takes Aglaia, the youngest Grace, as his wife. Dionysos weds Ariadne, whom Zeus rescues from death and decay.

The poem then moves outward into the wider world, recounting further divine unions that produce heroes and legendary kings. Demeter lies with Iasion and bears Ploutos, giver of wealth. Eos bears Memnon and Emathion, and later Phaethon. Callirrhoe bears Geryon, whom Heracles later slays. Thetis bears Achilles to Peleus, and Aphrodite bears Aeneas to Anchises. Circe bears sons to Odysseus, and Calypso bears children to him as well.

Hesiod closes by noting that these are the goddesses who lay with mortal men and bore children like the gods, completing his account of the divine order and its extension into the world of heroes and humankind.
